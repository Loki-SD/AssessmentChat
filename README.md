# Steps to Start the App

Install the Public Dependencies

Install the Server Dependencies

In the Server Directory there's a .env file. 
Change the value of mongodb inside the file. 
Set the value as your mongodb connection url.

/*cd server*/

Now start the server by yarn start

/*cd public*/

Now start the public by yarn start


And the chat application would be running successfully by now.
